Assuming that you know what Haskell is (if not, [read this brief introduction](https://lautarolobo.xyz/blog/what-s-haskell/)), and you know what the Glasgow Haskell Compiler is (check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler) if you don't), I'll show you how to get GHC up and running in your computer.

First things first, open the terminal and type:

```console
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
```

This command should work on the most common Linux distros out there ([Debian](https://www.debian.org/index.en.html), [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)). 

Press Enter, and you will be asked to type your password, after you type it you'll see a list of sugested packages, those won't be installed, and a list of the packages that will be installed, with the amount of space that they are willing to occupe in your drive. Classic pre-installation info. Then you must type _s_ if you want to proceed with the installation, or _n_ if you regret.

Have in mind that the installation process once you type _s_, may take some time depending in your internet conection.

Following this simple operation, you have your Glasgow Haskell Compiler installed, ready to use.

If you want to make sure that it's installed, just open the terminal and simply type:

```console
ghci
```

Therefore you should see in your console something like this:

```console
GHCi, version x.y.z: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> 
```
